## FAQ

### What is this?

This is an implementation of an arbitrary style transfer algorithm
running purely in the browser using TensorFlow.js. As with all neural 
style transfer algorithms, a neural network attempts to "draw" one 
picture, the Content (usually a photograph), in the style of another, 
the Style (usually a painting). 

Although [other browser implementations](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs)
of style transfer exist,
they are normally limited to a pre-selected handful of styles, due to
the requirement that a separate neural network must be trained for each
style image.

Arbitrary style transfer works around this limitation by using a
separate *style network* that learns to break down *any* image into 
a 100-dimensional vector representing its style. This style vector is 
then fed into another network, the *transformer network*, along
with the content image, to produce the final stylized image.

### Is my data safe? Can you see my pictures?

Your data and pictures here never leave your computer! In fact,
this is one of the main advantages of running neural networks 
in your browser. Instead of sending us your data, we send *you* 
both the model *and* the code to run the model. These are then 
run by your browser.

### What are all these different models?

The original paper uses an Inception-v3 model 
as the style network, which takes up ~36.3MB 
when ported to the browser as a FrozenModel.

In order to make this model smaller, a MobileNet-v2 was
used to distill the knowledge from the pretrained Inception-v3 
style network. This resulted in a size reduction of just under 4x,
from ~36.3MB to ~9.6MB, at the expense of some quality.

For the transformer network, the original paper uses 
a model using plain convolution layers. When ported to
the browser, this model takes up 7.9MB and is responsible
for the majority of the calculations during stylization.

In order to make the transformer model more efficient, most of the
plain convolution layers were replaced with depthwise separable 
convolutions. This reduced the model size to 2.4MB, while
drastically improving the speed of stylization.

This demo lets you use any combination of the models, defaulting
to the MobileNet-v2 style network and the separable convolution
transformer network.

### How big are the models I'm downloading?

The distilled style network is ~9.6MB, while the separable convolution
transformer network is ~2.4MB, for a total of ~12MB. 
Since these models work for any style, you only 
have to download them once!

### How does style combination work?

Since each style can be mapped to a 100-dimensional 
style vector by the style network,
we simply take a weighted average of the two to get
a new style vector for the transformer network.

This is also how we are able to control the strength
of stylization. We take a weighted average of the style 
vectors of *both* content and style images and use 
it as input to the transformer network.

## Running locally for development

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependencies.

To run it locally, you must install Yarn and run the following command at the repository's root to get all the dependencies.

```bash
yarn run prep
```

Then, you can run

```bash
yarn run start
```

You can then browse to `localhost:9966` to view the application.


## Credits

This demo could not have been done without the following:

* Authors of the [arbitrary style transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830) paper.
* The Magenta repository for [arbitrary style transfer](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization).
* Authors of [the MobileNet-v2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).

* The [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org).
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), with which I was able 
to do all necessary training using a free(!) GPU.

As a final note, I'd love to hear from people interested 
in making a suite of tools for artistically manipulating images, kind of like 
[Magenta Studio](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio)
but for images. Please reach out if you're planning to build/are 
building one out!
